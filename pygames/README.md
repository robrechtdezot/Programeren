## Files Description

- **graphics/3/3_enemies_1_attack_000.png**: This image file is used for character animations or sprites in the game.

- **graphics/5/5_enemies_1_attack_000.png**: This image file is used for different character animations or sprites in the game.

- **graphics/Battleground1.png**: This image serves as the background for the game.

- **graphics/sky.png**: This image represents the sky background in the game.

- **font/BreatheFireIii-PKLOB.ttf**: This is a TrueType font file used for rendering text in the game.
